## Development

```
yarn
yarn dev:server
```

That should start the server. It will open to http://localhost:3000.

If you'd like to just develop the UI, you can use

```bash
yarn
yarn dev:client
```

To start the native vite client.

## Building

```
yarn build
yarn serve
```

prod start => pm2 start npm --name my-app -- run serve
